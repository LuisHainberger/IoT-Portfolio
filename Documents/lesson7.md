 - there will be an estimated 26 billion units installed globally by 2020. Where to store this large quantities of data
 - how to analyze this large quantities of data (in realtime)
 - companies have to change their whole infrastructuren (huge costs)
 - There will also be significant security challenges from the increasing amount of data with the myriad of devices increasing security complexity. This, in turn, will have an impact on availability requirements, which are also expected to increase, putting real-time business processes at risk
 - storage servers are only being used to between 30 and 50 percent of capacity, the physical capabilities are there. Managing them, however, is an entirely different problem.
 - due the scale of the data being created it will no longer be economically feasible to store data at a single location

 - Ten years ago, most of us had to only worry about protecting our computers. Five years ago, we had to worry about protecting our smartphones as well. Now we have to worry about protecting our car, our home appliances, our wearables, and many other IoT devices
 - wifi connection is always unsecure
 - cheap iot producers are lacy in updating software(security issue)
 - iot companies sell user data
 - Computers have automatic updates partly because most users are too lazy to perform even the basic steps needed to keep their computer safe. And when you consider that protecting the myriad IoT devices will be even harder than a single computer, this problem will get even worse

 - how to name all those devices
 - devices will become an increasing stress on the network(large bandwith needed)

 (Gerhard WÃ¼hrer)
- open source software to ensure security
- no longer security by obscurity
- containerize software entities to keep it secure
