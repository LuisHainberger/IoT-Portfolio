### Name three implemented successful business ideas
 - Bigbelly, founded in 2003 by two college students. The company manufactures solar-powered devices that, on the surface, look like regular garbage cans. But inside rests a sophisticated trash compactor with sensors that monitor how full the cans are and sends notifications to the appropriate officials through the cloud when the cans need to be full.
 - Runtastic
 - Another popular device is the mobile credit card reader that connects to smartphones and tablets. Square is the household name in this regard, as businesses from food trucks to flea markets use the card reader to process transactions easily.
 
 ## Name three implemented failed business ideas
 - ZEO was a manufacturer of a sleep monitor in the form of a headband, that contained an EEG unit monitoring the user's brain waves.
The sleep monitor was able to detect and record sleep stages, and awake at the optimal time, in light sleep.
Using analytics, users were provided with recommendations based on each individual's sleeping patterns.
Zeo has stopped operating in December 2012, and Q2 2013, it quietly shut down. According to founder Dave Dickinson, problems included the business model, with a "suboptimal profit margin", invasiveness of the headband device for some user, and friction caused by the user having to log into the website to enter additional data. Moreover, the sleep data was not necessarily suitable for a small mobile screen.
 - GreenGoose: SensibleSelf makes wireless "lifestyle" sensors that measure personal behaviors.
The application, GreenGoose is built on the patent-pending technology and provides a game platform for measuring the things we do.
The sensors are stickers. They automatically measure things like getting exercise, brushing your teeth, flossing, riding your bike, taking vitamins, and lots more. Users simply stick the sensors on objects like a toothbrush. The battery lasts a year; no recharging; 250ft range.
Behaviors are measured, wirelessly transmitted, and stored in a database. GreenGoose assigns "lifestyle points" and a virtual game-play environment that changes as users do things in the real-world. It also provides self-tracking and nudge "goose" mechanisms for keeping intentions.
GreenGoose also enables other games and applications with an API. Applications may leverage user supplied behavioral data to offer rewards or other incentives for doing positive things. For instance, you could level-up in a different game by riding your bike or getting exercise. Or, users could earn points toward virtual goods or credit transferable to loyalty programs with retailers.ss
 - SpaceCurve is a data platform designed for the Internet of Things.
