## Predictive Maintenance
#### What is predictive maintenance?
- Predictive maintenance (PdM) techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted.




#### What problem does it solve?
- The main promise of predictive maintenance is to allow convenient scheduling of corrective maintenance, and to prevent unexpected equipment failures.
- The key is "the right information in the right time". By knowing which equipment needs maintenance, maintenance work can be better planned (spare parts, people, etc.) and what would have been "unplanned stops" are transformed to shorter and fewer "planned stops", thus increasing plant availability. Other potential advantages include increased equipment lifetime, increased plant safety, fewer accidents with negative impact on environment, and optimized spare parts handling.
#### How is it related to the IoT. 
- Because the IoT solution uses real-time machine data and sophisticated analytics to determine equipment health – so you can predict and prevent failures.
#### Give 3 examples of predictive maintenance in the IoT
- Aircondition
- windmil
- compressors
- railway

#### Which role does data analytics play?
- Detecting failures in early stages and preventing them
- Finding ‘Remaining life of asset’
- Schedule predictive maintenance
- Maintaining “Right level of inventory” for spare parts
- Evaluate “What if” alternate scenarios
- Determine right warranty period for the assets at the design time
- Predict breakdown
- Notify operator at right time
- Prevent risk of collateral damage and secondary failure
- Prevent high production downtime
- Maximizing equipment life

#### How does a heartbeat monitor in a network work?
- In computer clusters, heartbeat network is a private network which is shared only by the cluster nodes, and is not accessible from outside the cluster. It is used by cluster nodes in order to monitor each node's status and communicate with each other.

- The heartbeat method uses the FIFO nature of the signals sent across the network. By making sure that all messages have been received, the system ensures that events can be properly ordered

#### What can it be used for?
- In this communications protocol every node sends back a message in a given interval, say delta, in effect confirming that it is alive and has a heartbeat. These messages are viewed as control messages that help determine that the network includes no delayed messages.
