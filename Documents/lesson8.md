# lesson 8
#### What is the relation bandwidth/range/power?
- increase power or increase bandwith to get more range
- long range but low bandwidth and low power (Lora)


#### What is the Link budget?
- link = connection between sender and reciever
- the bigger a obstacle (tree, wall,..) is the more link budget is used for sending a message
- if the link budget is used up the reciever only creates some noise -> no data output
- link budget (lora) = 154db (LTE only 130db)
- A link budget is accounting of all of the gains and losses from the transmitter, through the medium (free space, cable, waveguide, fiber, etc.) to the receiver in a telecommunication system. It accounts for the attenuation of the transmitted signal due to propagation, as well as the antenna gains, feedline and miscellaneous losses. Randomly varying channel gains such as fading are taken into account by adding some margin depending on the anticipated severity of its effects. The amount of margin required can be reduced by the use of mitigating techniques such as antenna diversity or frequency hopping
### examples:
 - earth moon communication
 -  line-of-sight radio system
 


#### What is the community approach?
- the community approach is built on privatly built and operated gateways
and an infrastructure, which transferes the messages from the gateway to a application

#### What are benefits with LORA?

- one device only uses one percent of the bandwidth
- low channel capacity
- needs low energy
- better range
- data security
 


#### what are problems with LORA?
- low data range
- different frequencies from area to area
- 1 connection channel, 2 way communication
- lora technology belongs to one company (price of modules is higher)

#### LORA in Austria and Linz
 - LINZ AG 
 
# TTN

What is TTN?

- The Things Network is a global, open, crowd-sourced Internet of Things data network.

What does it stand for?
- the things network
Which problems does it solve?
- The Things Network uses the LoRaWAN network technology to provide low power wireless connectivity over long range.
- security(update) problems


How does it solve them
- it layers the IoT-Network (Nodes, Gateways, Backend)
