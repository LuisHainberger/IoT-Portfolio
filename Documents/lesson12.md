# Presentation Day

## My opinion:

- Group1(Flatty) was the best group because they had the absolute funniest presentation and a very original idea.
- Group2 (Car pacour drinking game) was the second best. They also made a very professional and funny video/presentation and their product was awesome.
- All other teams also did a really good job and the gap was not large between the teams (very original ideas and funny and kreative presentations as we know from MC15)
